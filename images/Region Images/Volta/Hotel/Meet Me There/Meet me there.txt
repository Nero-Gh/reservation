Meet Me There
On the Anyanui road, Dzita Ghana

Meet Me There sits between the villages of Dzita and Dzita-Abledomi on the stunning coast of the Volta Region, Ghana. â€‹ We offer a calm, relaxing and eco-friendly experience. We pride ourselves on our friendly service and for creating a beautiful environment which boasts the rich culture Ghana is blessed with. Fall asleep to the sound of crashing waves and wake up to the traditional songs of local fisherman. We are a not-for-profit lodge which supports the work of our NGO 'Dream Big Ghana', a charity dedicated to improving sanitation, education and health care for local people. Your stay with us will directly contribute to these activities.
